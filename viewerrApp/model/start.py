# The model implements the observer pattern. This means that the class must
# support adding, removing, and alerting observers. In this case, the model is
# completely independent of controllers and views. It is important that all
# registered observers implement a specific method that will be called by the
# model when they are notified (in this case, it is the `model_is_changed`
# method). For this, observers must be descendants of an abstract class,
# inheriting which, the `model_is_changed` method must be overridden.
